# Getting started

To run this project please first run `npm install` and ensure that you have nodemon
installed by running `npm install -g nodemon` (this will install nodemon globally).

Afterwards you can run the application by running `nodemon server`. To ensure
that everything is functioning as intended, navigate to `http://localhost:8080/` 
on your local browser and it should redirect you to a page that says "API is working
properly"
