    This project consists of a model which will use machine learning to identify different
    types of snacks as well as common pantry items. The idea is to create a program that
    monitors and reports all items in a users pantry and will offer smart recommendations, 
    i.e.: if you are running low on certain items or if there are healthier alternatives
    to items in your pantry. The user can then manage pantry information, see whatâ€™s
    currently in their pantry, and also visualize information about their pantry via
    lists or graphs. This project consists of a model which will be trained using machine
    learning to identify different types of snacks and common pantry items. A Raspberry Pi
    that is connected to a camera will be utilized in conjunction with a neural network to
    identify items in the users pantry. The items that are detected by the camera will then
    update the users account on a webpage automatically on an event triggered basis.
